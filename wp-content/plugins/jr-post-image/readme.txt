JR Post Image is a light-weight plugin that displays an image or multiple images 'attached' to a post in a SEO friendly way.

== Description ==

JR Post Image is a light-weight plugin that displays an image 'attached' to a post in a SEO friendly way. It can be used on the frontpage of your blog, but also on a post/page, to show all images attached to the post. (All images in the post Image Gallery).


**Features:**

*   Makes your Wordpress blog look nicer
*   SEO friendly, automatically fills in alt-tag, and image dimensions
*   Automatically uses the right image dimensions, as set in your Wordpress admin panel (under Settings->Media 'thumbnail' size)
*   Does not slow down your blog, because the thumbnails are already generated by Wordpress itself by default!
*   Very lightweight, small code
*   Images can be easily styled using CSS


**Demo:**
Check out my website [PianoMusician.nl](http://www.pianomusician.nl/ "JR Post Image Demo"), the plugin is used on the frontpage and every post/page.

== Installation ==

Installation is very easy:

1. Upload `jr-post-image.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate the plugin
1. Place `<?php jr_post_image($id); ?>` in your theme's `index.php` file, that's where the image will show up.
1. Go to Settings -> Media, and change the 'Thumbnail' dimensions to your desired dimensions.
1. Upload images to a post, you don't have to insert them in the post itself (as long as they're in the gallery it's OK).

You can change additional settings under Settings -> JR Post Image.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this slow down my blog? =

No. Wordpress generates the thumbnails by default.

= How can I disable the JR Post Image for one specific post or page? =

Add an custom field to the post named 'jr_nopostimage' with the value 'true' (without quotes). Then the post image won't be showed in the post itself, it will be showed on the index page.

= How can I change the image CSS style? =

You can use the CSS class `.jr-post-image` and style the image. Soon you can also change the css class name in the configuration page.

== Screenshots ==

1. 'Make Link' enabled. The image links to post.
2. 'Make Link' disabled. Just the image is showed, not clickable.
3. Configuration page preview.
